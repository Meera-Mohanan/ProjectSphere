# ProjectSphere - Project Management

## Description
ProjectSphere is a project management application that allows users to create projects and tasks to help track their work. The application allows users to perform various operations such as adding, updating, and removing projects and tasks. Working on ProjectSphere allowed me to gain valuable experience with react and setting up a mongo database. Utilizing graphQL allowed me to create a more efficient application by only querying the data I needed.
